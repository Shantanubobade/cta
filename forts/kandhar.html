                Located at a distance of 50 km from Ranthambhore National Park, Kandhar Fort was built nearly 1200 years ago by King Krishna III of Malkhed. Its architecture is quite similar to that of the Shivneri forts in Maharashtra. Known for its wonderful architecture, it is surrounded by a canal filled with water. Do pay a visit to the fort and make your trip to the land worth it!
