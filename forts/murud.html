                A marvellous spectacle, the Murud Janjira fort is in the sea. The fort has a few escape gates, 26 rounded bastions, a ruined mosque, and a pool that today lies empty. Inside the fort are also three gigantic cannons that are famously called Kalalbangdi, Landa Kasam, and Chavri.

To get to the fort, one has to take a boat that departs from the dock. You can either rent a private boat for Rs. 600 or choose to book a ticket for Rs. 20 per passenger. <br> <br>

Location: Murud <br>
Visiting Hours: 7 am to 6 pm <br>
Nearest Railway Station: Nagothane
