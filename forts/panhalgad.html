                One of the more famous forts in Maharashtra, the Panhala Fort was the battleground in many wars, the most famous being the Battle of Pavan Khind. The fort is believed to the former home of Tarabai, the queen of Kolhapur. On the fort premises one can see the Andhar Bavadi, an underground well, the Kalavantinicha Mahal, and the Amberkhana, the site of the three granaries inside the fort.

There are also a few temples within the fort, one of them dedicated to Sambhaji II. The other is the famous Ambabai Temple, believed to be where Shivaji used to offer prayers before going on expeditions. <br> <br>
