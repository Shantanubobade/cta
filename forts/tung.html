                A small fort located in the outskirts of Pune, the Tung Fort was built by Adil Shah sometime before 1600 CE. It has seen plenty of wars, the famous ones being between the Marathas and the Moghuls. The Tung Fort is well known for its conical and oval shape and as a trail for experienced trekkers. Inside the Tung Fort, there are steep steps that lead to a former water reservoir that now lies in ruins. The climb up to the Tung Fort is quite difficult to navigate through, so itâ€™s best to go with a guide if you are planning a trek to the fort. <br>
