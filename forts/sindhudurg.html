                Situated on the shores of the Malvan region, the Sindhudurg Fort is spread over 43 acres of land. It took about three years to construct. The fort has a massive wall that served two purposes: it protected the fort from the sea and it prevented enemies from trespassing. Within the limits of the fort are a few houses and temples dedicated to lords Maruti, Mahadeo, and Mahapurush. Entry to the fort during the monsoon is restricted because of the high tides that reach the top of the fort in the rainy season. <br> <br>
Location: Malvan <br>
Visiting Hours: 9 am to 5 pm <br>
Nearest Railway Station: Sindhudurg
