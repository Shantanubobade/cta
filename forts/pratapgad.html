                The Pratapgad Fort, Maharashtra, is an important fort built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Actually, the main fort consists of two forts (one at the top of the hill and the other at the south-east end). The Pratapgad Fort is known for the battle of Pratapgad that took place between Shivaji Maharaj and Afzal Khan. Popular attractions at the Pratapgarh Fort, Maharashtra, are the tomb of Afzal Khan and the temple dedicated to Goddess Bhavani. Just about 25 kilometres away from the Pratapgad Fort is the popular hill station Mahabaleshwar, which is an ideal place for a weekend getaway. <br> <br>
