                Consider to be the birthplace of Shivaji Maharaj, the Shivneri Fort holds high esteem in Maratha and Maharashtrian history. The fort was constructed in a unique triangular shape and had many mosques, ponds and a tomb inside. Inside the Shivneri Fort, there is a temple that is dedicated to Goddess Shivai Devi and a massive chain gate at the entrance. Noteworthy sites here are the statues of Jijabai and a young Shivaji. The climb up to the fort is pretty easy. However, if you are good at trekking, you can try going up to the fort from the chain route located on the western side of the fort (this would be a bit challenging for amateurs). <br> <br>
