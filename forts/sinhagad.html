Located close to the city of Pune, the Sinhagad Fort gets its name from the Marathi word Lion. One of the more popular forts in Maharashtra, Sinhagad Fort is believed to have been conquered by Tanaji Malusareâ€™s brother from the Mughals. At the fort, you will see a few old stables that were believed to have been used by the Maratha army to keep their horses. There is also a memorial built in honour of Tanaji Malusare, a brave Maratha warrior. Inside the ruins of the fort also lies the tomb of Rajaram Chhatrapati and a small temple dedicated to Goddess Kali. <br> <br>
